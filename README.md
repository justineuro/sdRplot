## sdplot.R

An [**R**](https://svn.R-project.org/R/) function than can be used for creating ***semantic differential*** (SD) inventory plots (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_differential for more info) .

You may have to change some of the graphing parameters, as the need arises, to get better quality plots.

This directory includes:

* sdRplot.R - the [**R**](https://svn.R-project.org/R/) script
* sdRplot.html - a [**knitr**](http://yihui.name/knitr/)-generated output of the example in the script
